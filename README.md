# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## How to see the error/problem happening?
```bash
npx vitest --coverage
```

Look at the GetAsync and RandomNumber components. Theyâ€™re simple, with working code inside comments. However, even with the code commented, if you try to run the tests, they will fail.

In my opinion, this issue causes significant confusion, making it difficult to test the code and reducing confidence in the libraries/frameworks. If a company relies on testing as part of its workflow, it could face major setbacks because of this.

```bash
# npm
